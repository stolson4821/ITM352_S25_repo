1.  Technical Requirements
    1. Data Handling and Input Validation
        The application must be able to accept CSV files as input and validate the file format. Ensure proper error handling if the file is missing required columns or is formatted incorrectly. The user should receive clear feedback if the upload fails.

    2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
        Before performing any statistical analysis, the application must clean the data. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring that columns with categorical data are correctly formatted.

    3. Descriptive Statistics Calculation
        The application must compute the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for all continuous columns in the dataset (e.g., Age, Income, Satisfaction Score). The result should be presented in a clear, tabular format.

    4. Support for Multiple Statistical Tests
        The application must support the following statistical tests:

        ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) for comparing means of different groups.

        Chi-Square Test for testing independence between categorical variables.

        Correlation Analysis to evaluate relationships between continuous variables.

        Linear Regression for modeling and prediction.

    5. Regression Analysis (Linear, Multiple, Polynomial)
        The application must provide regression analysis capabilities:

        Single Linear Regression: Use a single predictor to predict the target variable.

        Multiple Linear Regression: Use multiple predictors for a target variable.

        Polynomial Regression: Apply polynomial regression for data that exhibits non-linear patterns.

    6. Visualization of Results
        The application must generate visualizations for key statistical outputs:

        Descriptive Stats: Display histograms, boxplots, or bar charts for numerical features.

        Scatter Plots: For exploring relationships between pairs of continuous variables.

        Heatmaps: Display correlation matrices between variables.

        Regression Plots: Show the fit line for linear and polynomial regressions.

    7. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
        The application should perform PCA for dimensionality reduction on a dataset with multiple continuous variables and provide a visualization of the explained variance ratio for each principal component.

    8. Clustering (KMeans)
        The application must implement KMeans Clustering to identify natural groups within the dataset based on selected features (e.g., Income, Credit_Score, etc.). It should display the resulting clusters in a 2D scatter plot.

    9. Logistic Regression for Classification
        The application must support Logistic Regression for predicting a binary outcome, such as Churn (0/1), using relevant predictors such as Income, Satisfaction_Score, and Website_Visit_Frequency.

    10. Model Diagnostics and Residual Analysis
        After performing regression analysis, the application should include residual diagnostics to evaluate the quality of the model:

        Normality of Residuals: Use a histogram or Q-Q plot to assess the distribution of residuals.

        Homoscedasticity: Check for constant variance of residuals.

        Independence: Ensure that residuals are not autocorrelated.

    11. User Interface (UI)
        The application should have a user-friendly web interface built using Flask. Users should be able to:

        Upload datasets via an intuitive interface.

        Select which analysis to run via dropdowns or checkboxes.

        View results and visualizations in a well-organized format.

    12. Output and Result Export
        The application must allow users to export results from any analysis (e.g., regression coefficients, ANOVA results) in CSV or Excel format for further examination or reporting.

    13. Performance and Scalability
        The application should handle large datasets (with hundreds or thousands of rows) without crashing or significant performance degradation. Efficient algorithms should be implemented for both statistical analysis and data visualization.

    14. Error Handling and Logging
        The application must have proper error handling throughout the codebase:

        If an error occurs during data processing, statistical analysis, or model fitting, the application should log the error and display a user-friendly message.

        The application should include logging mechanisms for debugging purposes.

    15. Testing and Debugging
        The application should include comprehensive unit tests to ensure that each statistical function and data preprocessing step works correctly. Additionally, integration tests should verify that the overall system functions as expected when combining data upload, analysis, and visualization components.

    Large datasets for performance and scalability testing.

    Regression Testing: After each new feature or fix, test the application as a whole to ensure no other functionality has been broken.
